# OOP in JAVA

To work with OOP, you should be able to identify three key characteristics of objects:
- The object’s behavior—What can you do with this object, or what methods can you apply to
it?
-  The object’s state—How does the object react when you invoke those methods? 
-  The object’s identity—How is the object distinguished from others that may have the same
behavior and state?
# Relationships between Classes
- Dependence (“uses–a”)
- Aggregation (“has–a”)
- Inheritance (“is–a”)
# Calendar
- GregorianCalendar(int year, int month, int day, int hour, int minutes,
int seconds)
