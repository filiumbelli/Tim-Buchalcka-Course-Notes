# Interfaces
- Cook table for classes
- Express the ability of an object or a class
- Interfaces never define inside of the method
- Class implements the given interface must supply definitions to all methods inside of the interface.
# Clonable
- Interface that helps to create hardcopy of a class
- Protected type because Object obj = completelyDifferentObject.clone() may cause problems.That's why we must use same type or similiar type of classes.

#Comparable
- compareTo method should be used in the implementing class
- helps to compare items objects with respect  to given function.
# Inner Classes
- Inner class methods can accces the data from the scope in which they are defined.
- Inner classes can be hidden from other classes in the same package
- Anonymous inner classes are handy when you want to define callbacks without writing a lot of code.
